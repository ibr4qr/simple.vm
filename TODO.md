## Todo

#### this is a fork from https://github.com/skx/simple.vm

- watchman ( done: build a watcher in rust )
- compiler for little version of javascript




### how the engine will work
#### hoping something gonna work 

- compile from javascript to bytecode, register based bytecode (( python | go ))
- compile from bytecode to raw binary bytecode ( written by https://github.com/skx in perl )
- intepreter will get the raw binary and run it ( written by https://github.com/skx in c )
